# Attendance-Tracker
This is a simple Python script for tracking attendance of participants.  
The user can input the names of attendees, and the program records them as present.

3. Type **`exit`** when you are done entering names.
4. The script will print the attendance status for all entered attendees.

## Requirements

## How to Run
